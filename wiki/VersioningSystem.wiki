#summary How the rolling release system works.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Why? =

The rolling release system allows us to make relatively minor changes and still have them seeded out within a very short space of time. Bugs don't have to stay in for any more than a month, if that.

= How? =

We intend to set up an RSS feed which webpage people can refer to and know when a new release is available. Since (at present) we only have a single PHP script, it's easy to upgrade.

If we change something which might break backwards compatibility, or provides a large amount of new functionality we may announce that this marks another "Edition" of the software. As of 06/06/09, we are presently at the "0th Edition," ie. a simple, preproduction script that shouldn't be put in place on an existing web site.
