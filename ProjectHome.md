The Advanced Web Typography project aims to improve usage of typographic features such as ligatures, kerning and correct quotation symbols in text on the Web. In particular, we aim to provide a system with which high-quality book typesetting can take place and appear in reasonable comparison to the output of TeX.

It's easy to setup and use - a single PHP file, and just one class which can be reconfigured almost infinitely.

It's released on a rolling release cycle. The present build is 30-June-09, codenamed "Leviticus."
